# RecipeAId — Architecture Overview

Living document describing the current system architecture. Updated alongside code changes.

---

## System overview

**recipeAId** is a recipe management application. Take a photo of a physical recipe card; OCR reads the title, ingredients, and instructions, which are stored in a database. Later, search for recipes by title or by the ingredients you have on hand.

### Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | ASP.NET Core 9, LiteDB 5 (embedded document database) |
| OCR provider | Mistral OCR API (`mistral-ocr-latest`), called directly from backend over HTTPS |
| Ingredient parser | Mistral AI public API (`mistral-small-latest`), called directly from backend over HTTPS — no local sidecar |
| Frontend | React 19, Vite 7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, TanStack Query v5, React Router v6 |
| PWA | vite-plugin-pwa (installable, standalone) |
| Testing | xUnit + Moq (backend), pytest (OCR sidecar legacy/reference), Cucumber.js + Playwright (BDD) |
| CI | GitHub Actions — BDD integration tests on every PR to main |
| Container | Docker Compose (2 services) |

### Dependency rule

```
Api → Core ← Data
```

Core has zero infrastructure dependencies. All interfaces live in Core.

## API reference

| Method | Route | Description |

| GET | `/api/v1/recipes/search/by-ingredients` | Ranked ingredient search (`?ingredients=&minMatch=1&limit=20`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/ingredients` | All known ingredients (autocomplete) |
| POST | `/api/v1/ingredients/parse` | Parse raw ingredient text via Mistral AI API; `502` if API key missing |
| GET | `/api/v1/recipes/{id}/images/{slot}` | Retrieve stored recipe image (`slot` = `title \| ingredients \| instructions`) |
| PUT | `/api/v1/recipes/{id}/images/{slot}` | Upload image directly to a recipe slot (multipart/form-data) |

## Data model (LiteDB)

Recipes are stored as documents in a LiteDB collection (`"recipes"`). Ingredients are embedded inside each recipe document — there is no separate ingredient collection or join table.

```
Recipe document
├── Id             (int, auto-increment)
├── Title          (string)
├── Instructions   (string?)
├── ImagePath      (string?)
├── RawOcrText     (string?)
├── BookTitle      (string?)
├── Servings       (int?)
├── CreatedAt      (DateTime, UTC)
├── UpdatedAt      (DateTime, UTC)
└── RecipeIngredients []
    ├── Name       (string, normalized lowercase)
    ├── Amount     (string?  e.g. "2")
    ├── Unit       (string?  e.g. "cups")
    └── SortOrder  (int)
```

**Image storage:** Recipe photos are stored in LiteDB `FileStorage` (same `.db` file, no extra volume). Keys follow the pattern `recipe/{id}/{slot}` (slots: `title`, `ingredients`, `instructions`). During the OCR flow, images are temporarily stored under `temp/{guid}` and committed to their permanent slot when the recipe is saved (client sends back the `imageKey` from the OCR response in `CreateRecipeRequest.ImageKeys`). Images can also be uploaded directly via `PUT /api/v1/recipes/{id}/images/{slot}`.

**Trade-off (accepted):** Ingredient search (`/search/by-ingredients`) requires a full collection scan because ingredients are embedded, not indexed separately. See ADR 0001 for full rationale.

**Ingredient matching:** `RecipeMatchingService` uses Damerau-Levenshtein (OSA variant, distance ≤ 2) so common typos and transpositions still find recipes. Exact matches score 1.0 and fuzzy matches score 0.8; results are ranked by total score descending, then by score/ingredient-count ratio.

**Nutrition estimation:** `GET /api/v1/recipes/{id}` enriches the response with a `nutritionSummary` object estimated by `RecipeDetailService` → `NutritionEstimatorService` → `IOpenFoodFactsClient`. The OFF API is called per ingredient (up to 4 concurrently, `SemaphoreSlim(4)`), with results cached in `IMemoryCache` (1 h sliding / 24 h absolute). If OFF is unreachable or no ingredients match, `nutritionSummary` is `null` and the recipe is still returned successfully. When `Recipe.Servings` is set, `NutritionSummaryDto.PerServing` is also populated. Attribution to Open Food Facts (ODbL) is displayed inline in the UI.

**DB file:** `recipeaid.db` (path configurable via `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`). No migrations — schema changes are applied in code. `ILiteDatabase` is resolved eagerly at startup so a corrupt file crashes the container at boot (visible in logs) rather than silently failing on the first request.

## Docker / Deployment

### Services

| Service | Port | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| frontend | 80 (HTTP→HTTPS redirect), 443 | nginx, self-signed cert |
| backend | 8080 | ASP.NET Core |

### Key Docker details

- Backend calls Mistral OCR and Mistral chat APIs directly (`MISTRAL_BASE_URL`, default `https://api.mistral.ai`)
- nginx SSE location block (`/api/v1/ocr-sessions/`): `proxy_buffering off`, `proxy_read_timeout 220s`
- nginx API location block (`/api/`): `client_max_body_size 10m`, `proxy_read_timeout 210s`
- HTTPS: self-signed cert generated at build time; `VM_HOST` build arg adds VM IP as SAN

## Phase history

All phases are complete.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Foundation — entities, interfaces, DTOs, EF Core, repositories |
| 2 | CRUD API — RecipeService, RecipesController, OpenAPI, CORS, error handling |
| 3 | *(removed)* Unit conversion — deleted, never used by frontend |
| 4 | Search API — RecipeMatchingService, ingredient search endpoint |
| 5 | OCR Integration — OCR provider adapter + OcrParserService + from-image endpoint |
| 6 | React Frontend — pages, API client, TanStack Query |
| 7 | Mobile-First Design + PWA — Tailwind, camera capture, planner, bottom nav |
| 8 | Integration Tests (BDD) — Cucumber.js + Playwright, 14 scenarios |
| 9 | LLM Ingredient Parser Sidecar — Ministral 3B, prompt injection defense |
| 10 | Async SSE OCR+LLM Pipeline — background task, SSE delivery, health polling |
| 11 | LiteDB Migration — replaced SQLite + EF Core with LiteDB; ingredients embedded in recipe documents |
| 12 | Image Storage — recipe photos stored in LiteDB `FileStorage`; temp→commit flow; GET/PUT image endpoints; RecipeDetailPage displays stored title image |
| 13 | Fuzzy Ingredient Matching — Damerau-Levenshtein (OSA, distance ≤ 2); exact hits score 1.0, fuzzy 0.8 |
| 14 | Health Check Caching — ingredient-parser `/health` caches `_model_loaded` flag after first successful Ollama check; subsequent checks return instantly |
| 15 | Replace Ingredient-Parser Sidecar — Ministral 3B Ollama sidecar replaced by Mistral AI public API called directly from backend; sidecar, 4 GB model volume, and 120s start period eliminated (ADR 0002) |
| 16 | Replace OCR Sidecar — PaddleOCR sidecar replaced by Mistral OCR API with a shared post-OCR sanitization boundary before draft parsing/refinement (ADR 0003) |
| 17 | Nutrition Estimates — estimated protein, carbs, fat, and fiber added to recipe detail; sourced from Open Food Facts public API behind `IOpenFoodFactsClient`; enrichment orchestrated by `IRecipeDetailService`; in-memory cache (1 h sliding / 24 h absolute); graceful degradation when OFF is unavailable (ADR 0004) |
| 18 | Servings Scaling — `Recipe.Servings` (already stored) is now exposed in `CreateRecipeRequest`, `UpdateRecipeRequest`, and `RecipeDto`. The add-recipe wizard captures base servings (Step 4). `RecipeDetailPage` shows a stepper that scales displayed ingredient quantities client-side using `scaleIngredients()` + `parseAmount()` utilities; unparseable amounts (e.g. "a pinch") remain unchanged. `NutritionPanel` receives the active display servings count. Servings must be between 1 and 999; values outside this range are rejected with a 400 ProblemDetails response. |
